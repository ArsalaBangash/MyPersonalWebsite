                        <h4>No rest for the weary, even during winter break</h4>

                        <p>The ten days of winter break 2016-2017 saw me attend
							my first concert in Canada, spend a fantastically
							eventful week in the United States and attend my
							first Canadian New Year's party. My tyrant of a
							scrum master (yours truly), however, forgot that
							I was supposed to be on furlough, and assigned me
							seven user stories to have finished by January 2nd
							when classes resume.
</p>

<br>


                        <p>I started with the easiest task first: overhauling
							the Start Screen's user interface. This user story
							morphed into overhauling the entire application's
							UI so that I didn't have to cringe every time I
							handed people the phone when having them test the
							app out. It was during this UI overhaul that I also
							changed the name of the application to βOLTℤ. The
							name came about during a conversation I had with a
							friend. The entire transcript of the conversation
							can be found at a data storage facility of whatever
							government spying organisation happened to be
							listening in that day. </p>



					<br>
                        <p>The next user story I tackled was factorization, and
							I started off by approaching the problem in the most
							childish, hacky, hard-coded way possible. Around 50
							foul lines of code had to be scrapped after I picked
							up a pen and wrote an algorithm that generated and
							checked factorization problems. And so a new "Bolt"
							was born. Every different mathematical concept tested
							in this app is referred to as a bolt, and up next
							after the factorisation bolt were the Trigonometry,
							Area Calculation, and Derivative bolts. </p>


						<br>

                        <p>However, those user stories had to wait because
							although they added more to the math testing
							portion of the application, they did little to
							make the app feel complete and well done to the
							user. And so I instead decided to work on a Settings
							menu and a Final Report Screen. The Final Report
							screen would present the user with data such as the
							amount of time they spent on a question and the
							number of attempts they needed to answer the problem
							correctly. </p>


						<br>

						<img src="img/screen4.png" height="25%" width="25%" align="right" position="absolute" padding="300px"/>


                        <p>Implementing the Settings and Final Report Screens
							was a stimulating challenge, and I learned a lot
							about fundamental Android practices during the
							implementation process. The Android support
							documentation and the Udacity Android Developer
							course helped a great deal when dealing with
							components such as RecyclerViews and Preference
							Fragments, both of which were crucial to the
							afforementioned User Stories.</p>

						<br>

						<p>Speaking of User Stories...if you've been keeping
							count, there's still three left, and it's already
							January 2nd. Classes start today, and I'm sitting
							writing a blog post about how and why I couldn't
							complete them instead of actually working on them.
							Ah well, I'm sure the scrum master will understand.
							He's a fairly reasonable guy once you get to know him. </p>
