                        <h4>A native development approach to the app and the
                        inspiration behind my ambitious project</h4>

                        <p>"You don't understand bro, I've wanted this to exist
                          for so long.  I've wanted this to exist before I had
                          a smartphone. I wanted something to help me out when
                          I was prepping for the SATs; 20 or more questions in
                          25 minutes without a calculator...people need help
                          with getting better at mental math." - Arsala, some
                        time in November, probably in the Stats Room</p>

                        <p>For years now, I've wanted to create a mobile
                          application that would help students and the general
                          public improve their ability to perform rapid mental
                          math. This application wouldn't be limited to the mundanity
                          of Math's 4 basic operators, and would have users
                          solving coordinate geometry problems and factorising
                          quadratic polynomials using only their noggin.
                          However, after a painstaking research process,
                          I arrived at the conclusion that an app cannot be
                          wished into existence. That is why during the summer
                          of 2016, I took my first concrete steps to making
                          this project a tangible reality. </p>

                        <p>I was learning Android development with a friend so
                          that we could publish our first game together,
                          and as I learned key Android development concepts,
                          I applied them to little side projects of mine.
                          The first tiny build of ConfirMAT (the title is still
                          in progress) was a by-product of me learning how grid
                          layouts work, and it involved simple addition and
                          subtraction. However even as I coded the simple
                          addition and subtraction components of the app,
                          I saw the potential it had.</p>

                        <p>It seemed as if I had an epiphany every week about
                          which new cross-platform mobile technology I would
                          use for development. My framework-swings would take
                          me from web-app to React Native to (Insert arbitrary
                          Javascript based Mobile development tool here).
                          Finally, one night, after a tonne of Computational
                          Theory, I sat down and coded Division and Multiplication
                          into the app using our good ol' Android Studio.
                          Seeing actual progress as I played on my phone trumped
                          all the theoretical advances I had made when deciding
                          the one framework that was going to save me time and
                          money when eventually having to develop for the iHipsters.
                           I thus decided to go native, and tailor the mental
                           math improvement to each platform.</p>

                        <p>It was naive of me to think that most people would
                          share my passion for this project. It took countless
                          people turning me down (okay it was more like five
                          people) to make me realise that this project wouldn't
                          get done by workers, but rather by enthusiastic
                          developers. But alas, there exists only one for now,
                          and he must go at it alone.</p>
